## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- One or more ServiceNow&reg; instances with REST API access
- Valid credentials for each instance

### Install from npm

```bash
npx happy-platform-mcp
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g happy-platform-mcp
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Happy-Technologies-LLC/happy-platform-mcp.git
cd happy-platform-mcp
npm install
# Source checkout: use node src/cli.js <command>, or npm link first.
node src/cli.js instance list
```

### Start the stdio server

After a global install, `happy-platform-mcp` with no arguments starts the
stdio MCP server:

```bash
npm install -g happy-platform-mcp
SERVICENOW_INSTANCE=dev happy-platform-mcp
```

An MCP host can use the global command:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "happy-mcp-server": {
      "command": "happy-platform-mcp",
      "env": { "SERVICENOW_INSTANCE": "dev" }
    }
  }
}
```

Or use `npx` with `command: "npx"` and `args: ["-y", "happy-platform-mcp"]`.
From a source checkout, use `node src/stdio-server.js`; source CLI commands
use `node src/cli.js instance ...`.

### Configure Instances

**Recommended: register metadata with the local CLI**

The CLI inherits the environment of the process that launches it. The CLI
does not auto-load `.env`; `.env` loading applies to the server/stdio
process only. For CLI use, export `HAPPY_CONFIG_PATH` in the shell (or set it
in the MCP host environment when the host launches the CLI). The actual
default registry path on every OS is
`<homedir>/.config/happy-platform-mcp/instances.json`, using native path
separators for that OS.

Credentials are prompted locally, masked, and stored in the operating system
keychain. A new CLI-written version 1 registry contains instance metadata and
canonical `credentialRef` values only; it does not contain plaintext
credentials. Legacy plaintext registry files are read-only compatibility
inputs, and the singular `SERVICENOW_*` environment fallback is retained only
for backward compatibility.

```bash
happy-platform-mcp instance add
happy-platform-mcp instance list
happy-platform-mcp instance test dev
happy-platform-mcp instance update dev
happy-platform-mcp instance remove dev
happy-platform-mcp instance migrate
```

`instance add` prompts once for the credentials required by the selected auth
mode and stores them before registering metadata. `instance credential set` is
only for rotating an existing credential or completing a metadata-only MCP
registration. `instance update` changes metadata only. Authentication changes
require `instance remove` followed by `instance add`. Secret prompts never put
values in command arguments, logs, or MCP messages. These
prompts require an interactive local TTY. In non-TTY automation, use a
pre-provisioned OS keychain entry and run metadata-only commands; the CLI will
not read secrets from stdin or silently fall back to plaintext.

To select a different metadata registry for the CLI, export
`HAPPY_CONFIG_PATH` before invoking it:

```bash
export HAPPY_CONFIG_PATH="$HOME/.config/happy-platform-mcp/instances.json"
happy-platform-mcp instance list
```

For an MCP server/stdio host, set the same variable in the host environment:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "HAPPY_CONFIG_PATH": "~/.config/happy-platform-mcp/instances.json"
  }
}
```

`HAPPY_CONFIG_PATH` supports `~` and relative paths. For migration, automatic
package-legacy -> user-registry migration is available only when the resolver
selects the package-relative `config/servicenow-instances.json` as
`readPath` and the distinct default user registry as `writePath`.
`HAPPY_CONFIG_PATH` normally selects both `readPath` and `writePath` and must
point to a metadata-only version 1 registry. If it points to a plaintext
source (the same file), the CLI refuses before any keychain write; source
bytes and keychain entries remain unchanged. Choose a distinct
`HAPPY_CONFIG_PATH` target, or unset it for the automatic workflow. Never
copy secrets into command arguments. For a non-package legacy source, use a
controlled distinct source/target workflow or manually use `instance add` and
the masked `instance credential set` prompt.

`SN-Register-Instance` normally applies a live registry reload and does not
require a restart. Restart the MCP server only for docs-only mode or when the
reload fails.

**Legacy compatibility:** `config/servicenow-instances.json` is a read-only
legacy migration input. The singular `SERVICENOW_*` environment variables are
the backward-compatible single-instance fallback only when no registry is
available. The package-relative file is not the CLI's writable location.

**Option B: Single Instance (legacy environment fallback)**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Server/stdio only: set legacy SERVICENOW_* variables in .env.
```

### Start the Server

```bash
# HTTP/SSE transport
npm run dev

# Stdio transport (for Claude Desktop)
npm run stdio
```

HTTP/SSE listens on `127.0.0.1` by default. To expose it through a reverse proxy or network interface, set both `HAPPY_MCP_BIND_HOST` and a high-entropy `HAPPY_MCP_API_TOKEN`; clients must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/instances

# Required when HAPPY_MCP_API_TOKEN is set
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HAPPY_MCP_API_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Multi-Instance Routing

Every live ServiceNow operation accepts an optional `instance` parameter, except `SN-Set-Instance`, `SN-Get-Current-Instance`, and `SN-Docs-*`. Omitting it uses the current session client's implicit target. Explicit routing is required when overlapping work may target different instances or race with `SN-Set-Instance`; concurrent calls against one stable implicit target do not require it. Explicit calls are cached by instance name, so calls to the same named instance share that client.

At stdio startup, `SERVICENOW_INSTANCE` selects a named JSON entry when set; otherwise startup uses the entry marked `"default": true`, or the first configured entry if none is marked. HTTP sessions use the configured default or first entry. If the JSON file is missing, ServiceNow environment credentials can provide the single fallback instance. The `"default": true` flag is startup configuration. `SN-Set-Instance` changes only the current session client in memory; it never edits configuration, and a new MCP session or server starts from startup selection again.

```javascript
// Uses this session client's current implicit target
await client.callTool({
  name: 'SN-Query-Table',
  arguments: { table_name: 'incident', limit: 10 }
});

// Safely query dev and prod concurrently
await Promise.all([
  client.callTool({
    name: 'SN-Query-Table',
    arguments: { table_name: 'incident', instance: 'dev', limit: 10 }
  }),
  client.callTool({
    name: 'SN-Query-Table',
    arguments: { table_name: 'incident', instance: 'prod', limit: 10 }
  })
]);
```

### Examples

The following transport-neutral examples show an MCP tool name followed by its arguments:

```text
SN-Query-Table
{ "table_name": "incident", "query": "active=true^priority=1", "limit": 10 }

SN-Create-Incident
{ "short_description": "Email service down", "urgency": 1 }

SN-NL-Search
{ "table_name": "incident", "query": "high priority incidents assigned to me" }

SN-Execute-Background-Script
{ "script": "gs.info('Hello');" }

SN-Set-Update-Set
{ "update_set_sys_id": "abc123..." }

SN-Batch-Update
{ "updates": [{ "table": "incident", "sys_id": "id1", "data": { "state": 2 } }] }

SN-Catalog-Search-Items
{ "keyword": "VPN access" }
SN-Catalog-Get-Item
{ "sys_id": "<catalog_item_sys_id>" }
SN-Catalog-Submit
{ "sys_id": "<catalog_item_sys_id>", "variables": { "requested_for": "jsmith", "justification": "Project X" } }

SN-Docs-Families
{}
SN-Docs-Sync
{ "family": "australia" }
SN-Docs-Search
{ "query": "create a Flow Designer action", "family": "australia" }
```

### Local Script Development

Develop scripts locally with version control and automatic sync:

```text
SN-Sync-Script-To-Local
{
  "script_sys_id": "abc123...",
  "local_path": "/scripts/business_rules/validate_incident.js"
}

SN-Watch-Script
{
  "local_path": "/scripts/business_rules/validate_incident.js",
  "script_sys_id": "abc123..."
}
```

### Natural Language Search

```text
SN-NL-Search
{
  "table_name": "incident",
  "query": "active high priority incidents that are unassigned"
}
```

Supports 15+ patterns including field comparisons, text searches, date ranges, logical operators, and ordering.

### ServiceNow Docs Search

Happy MCP can retrieve official ServiceNowDocs markdown directly from GitHub and optionally localize a docs family into a SQLite FTS5 index for fast local search. Local indexing is disabled by default; enable it with `docs.localIndexEnabled=true` in the version 1 registry or `HAPPY_DOCS_ENABLE_LOCAL_INDEX=true`.

```text
SN-Register-Instance
{ "name": "dev", "url": "https://your-instance.service-now.com", "username": "your-username" }

SN-Docs-Families
{}
SN-Docs-Status
{}
SN-Docs-Sync
{ "family": "australia" }
SN-Docs-Search
{ "query": "update set best practices", "family": "australia", "limit": 5 }
SN-Docs-Get
{ "family": "australia", "path": "platform/example.md" }
```

`SN-Register-Instance` accepts metadata only. It never accepts passwords,
client secrets, or other secret fields. If a required local credential is
missing, its response gives the exact `happy-platform-mcp instance credential
set ...` command to run locally. Registration persists metadata, but a
docs-only server must be restarted before live ServiceNow tools are enabled.

SQLite local indexing is optional and disabled by default. Vector search is also optional; enable local indexing, set `HAPPY_DOCS_ENABLE_VECTOR=true`, and use `HAPPY_DOCS_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=local` to build a sqlite-vec index with deterministic local embeddings. See [ServiceNow Docs Search](docs/SERVICENOW_DOCS_SEARCH.md).

For docs-only deployments without ServiceNow credentials, set `HAPPY_MCP_DOCS_ONLY=true`. If no config file or ServiceNow environment credentials are present, the stdio server falls back to docs-only mode automatically.

### Runtime instance selection

Registration and runtime selection are separate:

- Registration persists an available named instance in the registry.
- `SERVICENOW_INSTANCE` chooses the stdio startup default only.
- `SN-Set-Instance` changes the sequential session's shared implicit target in memory; it does not edit the registry.
- The optional per-call `instance` argument selects an isolated request target, so concurrent calls can route to different instances without racing the sequential target.

## Claude Desktop Integration

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

For a global install, no arguments starts stdio:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "happy-mcp-server": {
      "command": "happy-platform-mcp",
      "env": { "SERVICENOW_INSTANCE": "dev" }
    }
  }
}
```

For an ephemeral install, use `command: "npx"` with
`args: ["-y", "happy-platform-mcp"]`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "happy-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "happy-platform-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HAPPY_CONFIG_PATH": "~/.config/happy-platform-mcp/instances.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The registry setting points to metadata; credentials remain in the local OS
keychain. `HAPPY_CONFIG_PATH` is optional with the default user path and must
be set before the server starts. For source installs, use
`node src/stdio-server.js` in the host config and `node src/cli.js instance
<command>` for CLI operations. Restart Claude Desktop after editing its config.

## Authentication

Happy MCP Server supports three credential flows per instance. Interactive
`instance add` captures each required secret once, stores it in the OS
keychain, and registers the metadata. Use `instance credential set` later only
to rotate an existing credential or complete metadata-only MCP registration.
Never place secrets in JSON or command arguments.

### Global CLI: dev basic authentication

```bash
happy-platform-mcp instance add
# Select Basic authentication; set the name to dev, enter URL and username,
# then enter the masked password when prompted. The command stores it once.
happy-platform-mcp instance test dev
```

### Global CLI: prod OAuth client credentials

```bash
happy-platform-mcp instance add
# Select OAuth -> Client credentials; set the name to prod, enter URL and
# client ID, then enter the masked client secret. The command stores it once.
happy-platform-mcp instance test prod
```

### OAuth password grant

```bash
happy-platform-mcp instance add
# Select OAuth -> Password grant; enter URL, client ID, and username, then
# enter both masked prompts. The command stores both credentials once.
happy-platform-mcp instance test password-prod
```

Password grant `credentialRef` must be an object containing both canonical
references:

```json
"credentialRef": {
  "password": "keychain:instance/password-prod/password",
  "clientSecret": "keychain:instance/password-prod/client-secret"
}
```

### Public authorization code with PKCE

```bash
happy-platform-mcp instance add
# Select OAuth -> Authorization code and enter URL, client ID,
# authorize URL, token URL, redirect port, and callback path.
happy-platform-mcp instance test public-dev
```

Public authorization-code metadata requires no `credentialRef` or client
secret. The first test/API call opens the browser flow and stores its refresh
token in the OS keychain.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

```bash
# Test configured credentials without exposing them in shell history.
happy-platform-mcp instance test <instance-name>

# Check server health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Common Problems

- **Multi-instance not working:** Verify the version 1 registry is valid JSON and has one `"default": true` instance when a startup default is needed. Normal live registration reloads without a restart; restart only for docs-only mode or a reload failure.
- **Tools not appearing:** Check MCP Inspector connection and server logs.
- **Auth failures:** Run `happy-platform-mcp instance test <instance-name>` and verify the local keychain credential reference and required ServiceNow roles.
- **SSE disconnects in Docker:** Enable keepalive (default 15s). See `docs/SSE_DOCKER_SETUP.md`.

### Debug Mode

```bash
DEBUG=true npm run dev
```

## Known Limitations

- Flow Designer logic blocks cannot be created via REST API (use the UI)
- Flow compilation/validation must be done in the UI
- UI Policy Actions linking requires a background script workaround

See the API reference and tool-specific guides under `docs/` for details.
