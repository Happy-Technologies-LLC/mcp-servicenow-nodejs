## üéØ Key Discoveries

### ‚úÖ Automated Background Script Execution
**Discovery Date:** 2025-09-29

Found that ServiceNow has a `/sys.scripts.do` UI endpoint that accepts POST requests. Combined with `sys_trigger` table, we can:
- Execute scripts automatically in ~1 second
- Auto-delete triggers after execution
- No manual copy-paste required

**Impact:** Major improvement in developer experience

---

### ‚úÖ Update Set Record Movement
**Discovery Date:** 2025-09-29

Successfully moved 43+ records between update sets using batch REST API operations. This allows:
- Fixing records that went to "Default" update set
- Bulk update set operations
- No background script needed

**Impact:** Simplified update set management

---

### ‚úÖ Flow Designer Feasibility
**Discovery Date:** 2025-09-30

Tested Flow Designer table operations and confirmed:
- Basic CRUD operations work via REST API
- Flow variables, stages, and components can be created
- Complex logic blocks require UI or templates
- Recommended 3-phase implementation approach

**Impact:** Enables basic Flow Designer automation

---

### ‚úÖ Workflow Programmatic Creation
**Discovery Date:** 2025-09-29

Discovered that workflows can be fully created programmatically:
- Activities store JavaScript in `input` field
- Transitions link activities
- Publishing sets `published` field and start activity
- Complete workflow lifecycle supported

**Impact:** Full workflow automation capability
